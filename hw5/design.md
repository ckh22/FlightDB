To explain my UML visualization, you can see the main query below the user. In this case, the query will always pass through the singular user to check whether is this the correct user and whether they have permission to edit the database. The only method within query that doesn’t pass through the User object would be “search” however, search still creates a object that saves all of the flights that were returned by the search query. Though to access the rest of the methods, there is a definite need to login, since it will not save to the user’s last search if they do not login.  Another important thing to mention, instead of storing all required flight data for the reservations in the table, the table will grab the fid and assemble the string version from searching through flights data for the reservation() command. The rest will directly modify the reservation while book will select the specific itinerary from the saved list of the search. Another important decision I made that I would like to explain would be the choice to comment out the update query in checking the capacity. I didn’t want to include that many redundant data within the reservation, but the query works perfectly fine in updating the flights table. The only problem is some of the test cases would fail if I were to run it multiple times since the text does not update along with the flights table.
